<h2 align="center"> XO GAME || Yossef </h2>


The XO game, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. With the power of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we bring this timeless game to life!

In this game, two players take turns marking their symbols on the grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw. The first player uses the 'X' symbol, and the second player uses the 'O' symbol.

Using the magic of JavaScript, every time a player clicks on an empty square, their respective symbol is placed there. The game intelligently detects winning moves and displays a victorious message with celebratory emojis when one player successfully lines up three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In case no player achieves a winning combination, the game declares a draw and showcases a neutral emoji to reflect the outcome.

To keep the game engaging, we have implemented an automatic page reload feature. After a win or a draw, the page refreshes automatically, allowing you to play again without any hassle.
